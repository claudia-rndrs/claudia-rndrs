## **Long intro**

Hi there 👋!<br>
I am Claudia, a hearing impaired (🦻) community builder and founder, who wants to make the tech industry more accessible and inclusive. The last five years I have been building <a href="https://womendotcode.be" target="_blank">women.code(be)</a>, **a supportive network for women who code and who are living in Belgium**. 

I started my own career as a PHP developer, but quickly moved to front-end development, from I transitioned in to the role of technical product manager and later on I switched back to front-end development and design (UX & UI)
It is mostly thanks to my versatile experience in tech that I have been able to grow women.code(be) into the community that it is today. 
 
Since 2023, I am also the **chairwoman** of <a href="https://fronteers.nl" target="_blank">Fronteers</a>, a Dutch organisation and community who are commited to professionalise the role of front-end developers.

Occassionally, you might also run into me at a <a href="https://fronteersbe.github.io" target="_blank">Fronteers meetup</a> , as I am currently the main **organiser Fronteers Belgium**. I still love being actively involved in the local front-end community, even though I am currently more of a hobby developer. 😊

During the (work)day however, it is more likely that you'll find me representing BeCode - a Belgian coding school with 4 different campuses across Belgium - as community lead. Here I spent most of my time building out a community to support the BeCode alumni, one step at a time. The first project I had the privilege to launch since I started as community lead, is a <a href="https://becode.org/about-us/women-mentoring-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Women Mentoring Program</a>.
